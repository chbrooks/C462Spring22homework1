# given the name of a file in the ARFF format, your code should:
# 1. Create a dictionary that maps attribute names to either potential values (if they're categorical) or the words REAL or INTEGER
# if those are the data types
# 2. Create a nested list containing the data itself - each element in the list should be one row of the dataset.
# 3. Return the most common classification.

# (note - these are the same as above - you probably want a separate function or method to do this.
# 3. Given the fraction of classifications, use randrange() to select a classification. So, for example, if the dataset contains
# 70% 'yes' and 30% 'no' examples, your program should generate 'yes' 70% of the time and 'no' 30% of the time.
